            Blogging Like a Hacker (in Training)

        <p>This is the 3rd time I have tried to start keeping a regular blog. I was hoping to document some of the things I've been learning, along with getting back into writing a bit regularly. The problem is that I did not enjoy using Wordpress or Tumblr for this purpose. It didn't feel too personal, although I quite enjoy both those platforms. I've been waiting for <a href="http://tryghost.org">Ghost</a> to launch, but decided to give Jekyll a shot in the meantime after seeing many software developers doing the same.</p>

<p>I wanted a clean, minimal layout partially for clarity but also to make it easier to initially launch this blog while continuing to learn Jekyll. I have recently switched to <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> for the layouts because I like their mobile first approach (although Bootstrap is doing the same with their 3.0 version). This particular layout style was influenced by <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/left/">Zach Holman's</a> Left Theme. I really enjoyed it's focus on the content and simplicity.</p>

<p>For the typography I knew I wanted to typeface which would look good on mobile as well as desktops. I chose <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Oswald">Oswald</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans">Open Sans</a>.</p>
